# Image_Classification_DecathalonDataset
This project aims to Classify Images from 10 classes in the Decathalon dataset. 
I've used Python for building a CNN model. I read the dataset into the Python using open CV library. I've standardised and normalized the dataset before feeding it to the CNN model. I've used 3 2d convolution layers and 3 Max pooling layers. In the first Convolution layer I've used 32 filters with size 3*3 and strides 1*1. All the convolution layers have RELU Activation functions. The input shape for the first Convolution layer is the size of the image and has 3 channels. All the MAx Pooling layers have a size of 2*2 with strides as 2*2 with the same padding. We add a Max pooling layer after the first convolution layer. The next 2 convolution layers have the same filter size and strides. We flatten the output of the Convolution layer and feed it into a fully connected layer with 64 nodes and RELU activation function. The output layer has 10 nodes. In total we have 257, 738 training parameters that are trained in 10 epochs.
